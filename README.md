This Flutter and Dart-based Quiz App is designed to offer a dynamic and customizable quiz experience. The app leverages powerful data structures like Map, ArrayList, and List to create an interactive and user-friendly quiz environment.

Key Features:
Data Handling:

We use an ArrayList to store user-selected answers, making it efficient to track responses.
A Map plays a crucial role by storing questions as keys and corresponding answers as values. This enables seamless association of questions with their correct answers.
Question Shuffling:

Each time the quiz is started, the questions are shuffled to present a new order, ensuring that the quiz is different on every attempt. This feature is implemented using a shuffled Map, adding randomness to the quiz flow.
Result Screen:

At the end of each quiz, a detailed result screen is displayed, showing correct answers in blue and incorrect ones in pink. This visual distinction provides a quick and clear overview of the user’s performance.
Customization:

Users can easily customize the quiz by modifying the questions and answers stored in strings, making the app adaptable to different quiz topics and formats without altering the core logic.
This app provides a robust framework for creating quizzes with randomization, tracking, and flexibility in customization. It’s a great foundation for educational tools or interactive tests, offering both developers and users a seamless experience.
